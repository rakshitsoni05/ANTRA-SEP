1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
Gives a Runtime Exception System.DivideByZeroException, as division by zero is undefined.

2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
Gives output as Infinity, -Infinity or NaN when numerator is positive, negative and 0 respectively.

3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its
range?
It wraps around to the minimum value and continues from there. 

4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?

x = y++; -- The value of y is assigned to x, and then y is incremented by 1.
x = ++y; -- y is incremented by 1, and then the new value of y is assigned to x.

5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop
statement?
break -- Exits the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement.
continue -- Skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
return -- Exits the current method and optionally returns a value. It terminates the loop and the entire method execution.

6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?

Initialization-- Executed once at the beginning (int i = 0;).
Condition -- Checked before each iteration (i < 10;).
Iterator-- Executed at the end of each iteration (i++;).

None of them are strictly required.

7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?

= It assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
== It compares the values on both sides and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.

8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;

Yes, this statement compiles and creates an infinite loop. 
The condition true is always satisfied, so the loop will run indefinitely.

9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?

the underscore _ acts as a discard pattern and matches any value not matched by previous cases. 
It's similar to a default case in a traditional switch statement.

10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement?

IEnumerable interface.
