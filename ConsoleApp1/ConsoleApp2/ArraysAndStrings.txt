1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C#?
Use String when your string data is immutable, meaning you don't need to modify it frequently. 
Use StringBuilder when you need to concatenate or modify strings frequently.StringBuilder is mutable, meaning it can be modified without creating new instances.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
The base class for all arrays in C# is System.Array. All array types in C# directly or indirectly derive from this base class.

3.How do you sort an array in C#?
You can sort an array in C# using the Array.Sort() method. 

int[] nums = { 5, 2, 3, 1, 4 };
Array.Sort(nums);

4.What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?

Length property can be used to get total number of elements in an array.

int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
int length = numbers.Length; //5

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?

Yes, System.Array in C# can store elements of multiple data types if the array is declared with the object type. 
This is because object is the base type of all other types in C#. 

What’s the difference between System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?

System.Array.CopyTo() method copies the elements of one array to another existing array.
System.Array.Clone() method creates a shallow copy of the array.
This means it creates a new array instance with the same length and elements as the original array, but the elements themselves are not cloned — they are referenced from the original array.
